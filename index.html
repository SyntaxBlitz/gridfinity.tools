        <p>
          To use Gridfinity, you'll need baseplates and then stuff to put on the
          baseplates. These come in standard sizes so that all Gridfinity
          modules are compatible with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many modules are custom-designed to hold
          <a
            href="https://www.printables.com/model/526946-gridfinity-caliper-holder"
            >particular objects</a
          >, but you can also download and print generic <em>bins</em> to store
          piles of objects like screws.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find downloadable baseplates or bins in various sizes, but
          using a <em>generator</em> lets you specify exactly the size you need
          for a particular situation and customize additional parameters (like
          the number of subdivisions in a bin).
        </p>
        <p>
          Bin generators are handy even if you want to design your own custom
          modules; you can use a generator to create a solid bin, then use CAD
          software to make cutouts that hold your objects.
        </p>

              This tool can generate simple bins, but where it shines is its
              ability to look at an item in a photograph, then make a cutout in
              a bin that fits the item snugly.

            This uses OpenSCAD within the browser, so all the bin generation
            happens on your computer without needing to install OpenSCAD. Since
            there's no server generating models, it tends to be reliable.

          <p>
            These are baseplates that, rather than holding modules in place
            using magnets, have tensioned “clicky” arms that are compatible with
            standard bins. I've never tried them, since I mostly print in PLA,
            which doesn't like to be held under constant tension like this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although there's no generator, there are some premade STL files for
            baseplates of all rectangular sizes between 1x1 and 7x7. You can
            download the <span class="non-foss">Fusion 3D</span> file if you

        <h2>Magnets</h2>

        <p>
          If you affix magnets to your baseplates and to your bins (or other
          Gridfinity modules), you get some extra grip. The idea is that
          <em>every</em> base on a bin will have four magnets on the corners
          (e.g. a 3x2 bin, containing 6 gridfinity bases, contains 24 magnets),
          and every cell in a baseplate has a matching four magnets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Magnets are handy for baseplates in drawers or toolboxes, where the
          movement could cause bins to slip, though you might find that your
          bins aren't at much risk of slipping anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naturally, to keep things interchangeable, you want to make sure all
          of your magnets are facing the same direction, for all of your bins
          and baseplates. If you have a buddy who's also into Gridfinity, make
          sure the two of you are using the same standard so you can trade
          modules!
        </p>

        <p>
          There's no one standard for magnet polarity, unfortunately, but the
          lightweight consensus seems to be that the magnet's
          <strong>north pole faces upwards</strong>; this is the standard I've
          settled on. This means that if you're looking downwards at a
          baseplate, you should be seeing the north poles of the magnets, and if
          you're looking directly at the bottom of a bin, you should see its
          magnets' <em>south</em> poles, so that when you place the bin upright,
          its north poles are facing the ceiling. This explanation might seem
          overly pedantic, but you'll understand my meticulousness after you've
          messed up your first few bins :)
        </p>

        <p>
          One strategy to save on magnets is to use a steel plate under your
          baseplate, especially if you're using the “thin” type of baseplate
          (which will have the bottom of the bin right up against the underside
          of the baseplate). This will also solve polarity issues, but you
          should follow a polarity standard anyway!
        </p>

        <p>
          I've found that, with magnets, most modules can stay in place even
          when the baseplate is held upside down; the stuff <em>inside</em> the
          bins, on the other hand, will fall on the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Gridfinity standard magnet size is 6mm in diameter and 2mm thick —
          or, at least, that's the general vibe of the specification. There are
          a few things complicating this:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Magnets sometimes run big or small (I think slightly small is the
            trend). This means that models designed for a “press fit” (where you
            just push the magnet into a round hole at the bottom of a bin and
            hope it stays there) might not actually hold magnets in very well.
          </li>
          <li>
            3D printers will sometimes print holes big or small, depending on
            things like your slicer settings and the filament properties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although the <em>placement</em> of magnets is more or less
            standardized, the means by which they're held in place varies
            depending on who designed the module. Not all bins are designed for
            a press fit; some designs for bin bases, for example, have you slide
            magnets in from the side, with or without glue to hold them in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Similarly, some tools will default to e.g. 6.5mm diameter magnet
            holes, presumably to keep them easier to insert. Others will
            silently shrink holes to make press fits tighter. It's chaos!
          </li>
          <li>
            If you print magnet holes with support material, you need to clean
            that material out really well to get magnets to fit. Consider a
            magnet hole style more conducive to
            <a href="https://support.makerbot.com/s/article/1667337959538"
              >bridging</a
            >, like the holes generated by gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Some people use a soldering iron to heat-insert magnets into holes
          that are a little undersized. This works (though it seems a little
          annoying to do), but magnets can lose their magnetism with heat
          applied. Does this end up mattering? I'm not sure, but enough people
          caution against it that I haven't bothered trying.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a while, I tried hot-gluing magnets into bins, but they don't last
          long like that (remember, any adhesive solution needs to be stronger
          than the magnets themselves!). What I've settled on recently is
          <strong>capturing the magnets</strong>
          <em>within</em> the 3D print on a bin, putting a layer or two down,
          printing a hole, pausing the print after the appropriate layer,
          dropping the magnet in, and then continuing the print, bridging more
          plastic on top of the hole (<em>without</em>
          a ferrous nozzle, of course!). The downside of this approach is that
          the magnets will be weaker with a couple layers of plastic holding
          them away from the baseplate, but at least they're consistent; I've
          had glued magnets that were inset too much or (worse) that poked out a
          bit, which doesn't happen here. I've also heard people complain of
          rattling magnets with this approach (since you don't want to make the
          holes too short, or you'll crash your 3D printer head into the
          magnets), but I've only rarely had that happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can typically buy magnets on Amazon or Aliexpress (<a
            href="https://amzn.to/3C4Id72"
            >here's an affiliate link</a
          >
          to the Amazon magnets I most recently bought; they're fine, though I
          haven't measured them for precision). I've been spending about USD
          $0.04 per magnet, including shipping. Is it worth the money, to add
          four of these to every 1x1 bin and four more to the baseplate? I
          dunno, but I do it anyway, because magnets are cool.
        </p>

        <h3>Gridfinity Rebase</h3>

        <p>
          Once you have a magnet strategy you're happy with — whether you're
          gluing them, press-fitting them, capturing them, or just omitting them
          altogether — you'll want all of your printed modules to use the same
          strategy. That way, you can dial in your settings for your particular
          printer, filament, and magnets, and stop worrying about the details.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, every module designer seems to have their own opinion
          on what magnet strategy to use. If you're frequently using others'
          modules, or just using a generator that doesn't support your favorite
          technique, you'll want to modify each base on the STL files you
          download.

        <h3>Magnet jigs</h3>

        <p>
          Magnet jigs are (3D printable) tools that help you insert magnets into
          bins and baseplates. They typically serve two purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Help you get the polarity right every time. After printing a jig,
            you glue or otherwise insert a permanent “reference” magnet into the
            jig, then place future magnets on the jig, aligning to the reference
            magnet, in some way that helps you insert them where they need to
            be. You need to be pretty clever to consistently insert the
            reference magnet correctly; I've come to realize that I'm simply not
            smart enough to do this right more than 50% of the time, so I just
            slap together a jig and hope it's right (and disassemble or toss it
            if not).
          </li>
          <li>
            Help you hold the magnet as you insert it, so that you don't
            fat-finger and flip the magnet while trying to insert it. Dropping a
            magnet normally gets it stuck on some other magnet, which is always
            a pain.
          </li>
        </ul>

              >
              by ichisaur. Magnets line up quite nicely on the plunger, and then
              you push the plunger away from the reference magnets before
              removing the device, so that the magnets don't stay stuck to the
              jig.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's got these little feet around the edge that grip the bin base,
              which are kind of satisfying to use, but they do sometimes cause a
              “click” as you're inserting or removing the jig, which can create
              undesirable vibrations; the feet also make it hard for the jig to
              fit in a 1x1 Gridfinity square.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personally, I have the jig reference magnet set “backwards”, since
              I insert magnets during the print from the top side of the bin,
              rather than coming at the bin from the bottom after it's printed.
              This jig works fine for that.

              Unfortunately, it does have the word “Bin” or “Base” debossed (to

              me who is incapable of getting the darn polarity right on the
              first try. I had to drill a hole into the opposite side of the
              magnet press-fit so I could push it out and try again. Consider
              just writing on the print which side it's for
              <em>after</em> inserting the magnet.

            This isn't a jig, but it's related to getting polarities right: your
            cell phone's compass can function as a magnet pole detector. Look
            for an app that can tell you which pole of a magnet you're pointing
            your phone at, then keep <em>very</em> careful track of which pole
            is which. It helps to mark one side with a permanent marker (I tend
            to mark the north side), but try not to rub the mark off..!

          You can print Gridfinity rulers to measure things in Gridfinity units.
